		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initial Hugo Site and Git Repository Setup",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Initial Hugo Site and Git Repository Setup' into a sequence of subtasks. The subtasks should cover installing Hugo via a package manager, creating a new Hugo site with the appropriate command, and initializing a Git repository within the newly created site directory.",
			"reasoning": "The task consists of a few straightforward, well-documented command-line operations. Its complexity is low, but breaking it into three distinct steps (install, create, init) ensures a clear, verifiable progression."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Install and Configure Hugo Theme",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Install and Configure Hugo Theme' into subtasks. The steps should include installing the specified theme using Hugo Modules, updating the `hugo.toml` configuration file to enable the theme, and verifying the theme is applied correctly by running the local server.",
			"reasoning": "This task is slightly more complex than the initial setup as it involves editing a configuration file, which can be error-prone. Separating the installation, configuration, and verification steps helps isolate potential issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create and Verify First Post with Hugo",
			"complexityScore": 1,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Create and Verify First Post with Hugo' into two subtasks. The first should be for generating a new content file using the Hugo CLI, and the second for running the local development server to confirm the new post is rendered.",
			"reasoning": "This is a very simple, fundamental Hugo action. It serves as a basic check of the setup. Two subtasks clearly separate the action (creation) from the validation (verification)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Obsidian Vault with Hugo using Modules",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Integrate Obsidian Vault with Hugo using Modules'. The subtasks should detail creating a dedicated content directory within the Obsidian vault, modifying the `hugo.toml` file to add a module mount that points the Hugo content directory to the new Obsidian directory, and creating a test post in Obsidian to verify it's correctly processed by Hugo.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves a more advanced Hugo feature (module mounts) and file system path configuration, which increases the potential for errors. Breaking it down helps troubleshoot issues related to directory structure, configuration syntax, or content rendering."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Align Obsidian Metadata with Hugo Front Matter",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Align Obsidian Metadata with Hugo Front Matter'. The subtasks should cover converting the front matter format of a test post from TOML to YAML and then verifying that Hugo can still correctly parse the metadata by running the local server.",
			"reasoning": "The practical action is simple (changing `+++` to `---`), but it's a critical conceptual step for the integration to work. Two subtasks separate the action from the verification, ensuring the change is understood and correctly implemented."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Automate Post Creation with Obsidian Templater Plugin",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Automate Post Creation with Obsidian Templater Plugin'. The subtasks should guide the user through installing the Templater plugin in Obsidian, creating a new template file with YAML front matter and a file-move command, configuring a hotkey or command to apply the template, and testing the entire workflow on a new note.",
			"reasoning": "This task's complexity comes from using a third-party plugin (Templater) with its own syntax and configuration within a separate application (Obsidian). A detailed breakdown into installation, template creation, template logic, and testing is necessary to manage this process."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up GitHub Repository and Pages",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Set Up GitHub Repository and Pages'. The subtasks should cover creating a new repository on GitHub, linking the local Git repository to the remote one, pushing the initial project files, and configuring the repository's settings to use GitHub Pages with a GitHub Actions build source.",
			"reasoning": "The process involves a mix of local Git commands and web UI configuration on GitHub. Separating these actions into distinct subtasks makes the workflow clear and easy to follow, especially for users less familiar with the full Git/GitHub lifecycle."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Automate Deployment with GitHub Actions",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Automate Deployment with GitHub Actions'. The subtasks should include generating the standard Hugo workflow file using the GitHub Actions interface, committing the new `.github/workflows/hugo.yml` file to the repository, and verifying the successful execution of the action by checking the 'Actions' tab and the live GitHub Pages URL.",
			"reasoning": "While GitHub templates simplify CI/CD setup, understanding the YAML file and debugging workflow failures can be challenging. Breaking the task into creating the file, committing it (which triggers the action), and then monitoring the run provides a structured approach to this automation step."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Local Pre-commit Hook for Build Verification",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Local Pre-commit Hook for Build Verification'. The subtasks should detail creating the `pre-commit` file inside the `.git/hooks` directory, adding the shell script commands to build the site and stage the output, and making the hook script executable to ensure it runs before a commit.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex because it involves shell scripting and direct manipulation of the `.git` directory, which is outside the typical developer workflow. The steps of creating the file, writing the script, and setting executable permissions are distinct and non-trivial."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Finalize and Publish First Post",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Finalize and Publish First Post'. The subtasks should represent the complete user workflow: creating a new post in Obsidian using the Templater template, committing and pushing the changes to GitHub, and finally, verifying that the post is successfully deployed and live on the GitHub Pages site.",
			"reasoning": "This task serves as an end-to-end test of the entire system. The complexity is low because it's about following the established process. Breaking it down into the main stages of the workflow (create, push, verify) ensures each part of the integrated system is functioning correctly."
