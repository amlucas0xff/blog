# UltraPlan: LlamaIndex Workflow Development

## Strategic Planning Template for Multi-Agent Workflows

### Workflow Analysis Framework

#### 1. Workflow Definition
- **Purpose**: What problem does this workflow solve?
- **Input**: What data/context does it require?
- **Output**: What should it produce?
- **Success Criteria**: How do we measure success?

#### 2. Agent Architecture Design
```
Agent 1: [Name] 
├── Purpose: [Specific responsibility]
├── Input: [What it receives]
├── Tools: [Available tools/APIs]
├── Output: [What it produces]
└── Handoff: [Next agent or completion]

Agent 2: [Name]
├── Purpose: [Specific responsibility]
├── Input: [What it receives from previous agent]
├── Tools: [Available tools/APIs]
├── Output: [What it produces]
└── Handoff: [Next agent or completion]
```

#### 3. Workflow Pattern Selection
- [ ] **AgentWorkflow**: Linear handoff pattern
- [ ] **Orchestrator**: Central coordinator pattern
- [ ] **Custom Planner**: DIY coordination logic
- [ ] **Human-in-Loop**: Interactive workflow
- [ ] **Streaming**: Real-time updates

#### 4. Implementation Strategy

##### Phase 1: Core Agent Development
- [ ] Define agent interfaces and base classes
- [ ] Implement individual agent logic
- [ ] Create tool integrations
- [ ] Add error handling and logging

##### Phase 2: Workflow Orchestration
- [ ] Implement workflow coordination logic
- [ ] Add state management between agents
- [ ] Implement progress tracking
- [ ] Add result aggregation

##### Phase 3: Interface Integration
- [ ] Add CLI command for workflow
- [ ] Create Streamlit UI components
- [ ] Implement real-time monitoring
- [ ] Add configuration options

#### 5. Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit tests for each agent
- [ ] Integration tests for full workflow
- [ ] Performance testing (< 2 min execution)
- [ ] Error handling validation

#### 6. Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Code documentation and type hints
- [ ] Usage examples and configuration
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Performance optimization notes

### Sub-Agent Specialization Patterns

#### Research Agent Template
```python
Purpose: Information gathering and analysis
Tools: [Tavily Search, Web Scraping, Data Processing]
Input: Research query/topic
Output: Structured research findings
Handoff Criteria: Comprehensive data collected
```

#### Writer Agent Template  
```python
Purpose: Content creation and synthesis
Tools: [LLM, Template Engine, Format Converters]
Input: Research data + content requirements
Output: Structured written content
Handoff Criteria: Draft meets quality standards
```

#### Reviewer Agent Template
```python
Purpose: Quality assurance and improvement
Tools: [LLM, Validation Rules, Feedback System]
Input: Draft content + quality criteria
Output: Reviewed content + improvement suggestions
Handoff Criteria: Content approved or feedback provided
```

### Workflow Complexity Guidelines

#### Simple Workflow (2-3 agents)
- Linear handoff pattern
- Clear input/output boundaries
- Minimal state management

#### Complex Workflow (4+ agents)
- Consider orchestrator pattern
- Implement robust state management
- Add progress monitoring
- Plan for parallel execution where possible

### Performance & Scalability Considerations

#### Target Metrics
- **Execution Time**: < 2 minutes typical
- **Memory Usage**: < 1GB during execution
- **API Efficiency**: Minimize redundant calls
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful failure handling

#### Optimization Strategies
- Cache expensive operations
- Implement smart retry logic
- Use streaming for long-running tasks
- Batch similar operations

This template ensures systematic planning and implementation of robust LlamaIndex workflows.
