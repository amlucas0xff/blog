# Obsidian Integration Success!

This post was created directly in the Obsidian vault directory and is being served by Hugo through the module mount configuration.

## How it works:

1. Content is written in the Obsidian vault at `/tmp/obsidian-vault/blog/`
2. Hugo mounts this directory as the `content` target
3. Hugo watches this directory for changes and rebuilds automatically

This demonstrates successful integration between Obsidian and Hugo!

**Update**: Pre-commit hook testing in progress...
