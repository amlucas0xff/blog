# Testing Obsidian to Hugo Sync

This is a test post to verify the automated sync workflow between Obsidian and Hugo.

## Features Being Tested

- ✅ Automatic content sync
- ✅ Front matter processing  
- ✅ Image handling (if images were included)
- ✅ Git integration

## Workflow

1. Write post in Obsidian vault
2. Save the markdown file
3. Sync script processes content
4. Content appears in Hugo blog
5. Git commit happens automatically

This should appear in the Hugo content/posts/ directory after running the sync script!
